ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that lets you interact with your database using Python objects instead of writing SQL queries.

In Django:
Models are Python classes that represent database tables.
ORM lets you create, read, update, and delete records using Python code.

Example:
To add a new book record: 
`Books.objects.create(title="Book Title", author="Author", published_year=2024)`

To retrieve all book records:
books = Books.objects.all()

To update an existing book record:

book = Books.objects.get(id=1)
book.title = "New Title"
book.save()


To delete a book record:

book = Books.objects.get(id=1)
book.delete()
